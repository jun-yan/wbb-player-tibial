## Data Structure and Notation

The unit of analysis is the **athlete–week**.

Indices:

- $i = 1, \dots, 10$ indexes athletes
- $t = 1, \dots, 10$ indexes weeks

Observed variables:

- $\text{PL}_{it}$: weekly average **PlayerLoad** for athlete $i$ in week $t$
- $\text{TIL}_{it}$: weekly average **total tibial impact load**
  (left + right tibia)
- $\text{TIL}_{R,it}$, $\text{TIL}_{L,it}$: right and left tibial impact load
- $t$: week number (season time)

Athlete-specific means are denoted by

- $\bar{\text{PL}}_i$
- $\bar{\text{TIL}}_i$

Missingness is sparse and unbalanced across athlete–weeks, and one
athlete–week (Athlete 10, Week 10) is potentially influential.

## Research Questions and Statistical Methods

### Research Question 1: Within-athlete concordance

**Do PlayerLoad and total tibial impact load track together over time within
athletes?**

This question evaluates whether week-to-week changes in a global workload
metric correspond to week-to-week changes in a segment-specific loading
metric for the same athlete.

**Statistical analysis.**  
PlayerLoad and tibial impact load were centered within athlete:
$$
\text{PL}_{it}^\ast = \text{PL}_{it} - \bar{\text{PL}}_i,
\qquad
\text{TIL}_{it}^\ast = \text{TIL}_{it} - \bar{\text{TIL}}_i.
$$

Within-athlete concordance was quantified by estimating the association
between $\text{PL}_{it}^\ast$ and $\text{TIL}_{it}^\ast$ using:

- a within-athlete correlation, and
- an equivalent regression slope from a no-intercept model applied to the
  centered variables.

**Uncertainty quantification.**  
Confidence intervals can be obtained via **athlete-level bootstrap
resampling**, resampling athletes with all associated weeks.

### Research Question 2: Temporal stability

**Is the association between PlayerLoad and tibial impact load stable across
the season?**

This question examines whether PlayerLoad serves as a consistent proxy for
tibial loading over time.

**Statistical analysis.**  
A longitudinal model was fitted with tibial impact load as the outcome:
$$
\text{TIL}_{it}
=
\alpha_i
+
\beta \, \text{PL}_{it}^\ast
+
f(t)
+
\varepsilon_{it},
$$
where $\alpha_i$ denotes athlete-specific intercepts and $f(t)$ represents
week effects capturing season-level trends.

Temporal stability was assessed by allowing the PlayerLoad effect to vary by
season phase or by including an interaction term
$\text{PL}_{it}^\ast \times t$.

**Uncertainty quantification.**  
Inference was based on athlete-level bootstrap confidence intervals.
Sensitivity analyses using exchangeable and AR(1) within-athlete correlation
structures were conducted.

### Research Question 3: Information loss

**How much tibial impact load variability remains unexplained after
accounting for PlayerLoad?**

This question quantifies the information lost when relying on a global load
metric alone.

**Statistical analysis.**  
Using the model above, unexplained variability was assessed through:
- within-athlete coefficients of determination, and
- prediction error measures (e.g., RMSE) for $\text{TIL}_{it}$.

Residuals
$$
e_{it} = \text{TIL}_{it} - \widehat{\text{TIL}}_{it}
$$
represent tibial loading variation not captured by PlayerLoad.

**Uncertainty quantification.**  
Prediction error metrics were summarized using athlete-level bootstrap
resampling.

### Research Question 4: Bilateral asymmetry

**Do athletes exhibit systematic left–right differences in tibial impact
load, and are these differences related to PlayerLoad?**

This question addresses information that cannot be recovered from PlayerLoad
by design.

**Statistical analysis.**  
Tibial loading asymmetry was defined as
$$
D_{it} = \text{TIL}_{R,it} - \text{TIL}_{L,it}.
$$

A longitudinal model was fitted:
$$
D_{it}
=
\alpha_i
+
\gamma \, \text{PL}_{it}^\ast
+
f(t)
+
\varepsilon_{it},
$$
to assess systematic asymmetry and its association with PlayerLoad.

**Uncertainty quantification.**  
Athlete-level bootstrap confidence intervals were used. Alternative asymmetry
definitions (absolute difference and log ratio) were examined as sensitivity
analyses.

### Research Question 5: Conditional divergence

**Under what athlete–weeks do PlayerLoad and tibial impact load diverge most
strongly?**

This exploratory question identifies contexts in which global and local load
metrics disagree.

**Statistical analysis.**  
Divergence was characterized by examining the magnitude of residuals
$|e_{it}|$ across athlete–weeks and summarizing patterns descriptively by
athlete and week.

**Uncertainty quantification.**  
This analysis was descriptive; robustness was assessed by sensitivity
analyses excluding potentially influential athlete–weeks.
